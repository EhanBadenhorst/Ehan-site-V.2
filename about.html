    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a second-year Software Engineering student at CTU Stellenbosch with a passion for building innovative digital solutions. I enjoy turning complex challenges into simple, user-friendly applications and am committed to continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic background has provided me with practical experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as a solid understanding of software development principles and version control using Git and GitHub. I have also gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, installation, and maintenance of hardware and software systems, and am currently expanding my skills in Java and Microsoft Azure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my IT expertise, I have extensive experience working on a farm, where I developed a strong work ethic, adaptability, and the ability to manage resources efficiently. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and maintaining impeccable records, as well as the value of technology in real-world, dynamic environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am fluent in both Afrikaans and English, and pride myself on my communication skills, professionalism, and ability to work independently or as part of a team. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects in software engineering, continue expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and system design, and make a positive difference through technology.
